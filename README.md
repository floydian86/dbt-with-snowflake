# dbt-with-snowflake
A set of data analytics pipelines for retail data leveraging dbt and Snowflake

In this project  , we'll convert raw retail data into an accessible orders model suitable for visualization purposes. We'll leverage the TPC-H dataset, which is readily available within your Snowflake account, and apply a variety of dbt's advanced functionalities to achieve this transformation. Upon completion, you'll possess a fully operational dbt project complete with tests and documentation, distinct development and production environments, and practical experience with the dbt git workflow.
