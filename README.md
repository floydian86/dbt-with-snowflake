# dbt-with-snowflake
A set of data analytics pipelines for retail data leveraging dbt and Snowflake

In this project  , we'll convert raw retail data into an accessible orders model suitable for visualization purposes. We'll leverage the TPC-H dataset, which is readily available within your Snowflake account, and apply a variety of dbt's advanced functionalities to achieve this transformation. Upon completion, you'll possess a fully operational dbt project complete with tests and documentation, distinct development and production environments, and practical experience with the dbt git workflow.

Here's the preview of the model that will be built using dbt (snapshot 1) and subsequently consumed in Snowflake to build a dashboard (Snapshot 2).
